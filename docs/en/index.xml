      <description>A new being has been created in the Studio of Body Design from an organic body and several found synthetic materials. This being thinks ecofeministically, but at the same time is aware that it arose from pollution and the material affluence of a post-capitalist society. It has appeared at three locations and in three states. First at the Rainbow Gallery in Prostějov, then in the Polish town of Zakopane in the Wladyslaw Hasior Gallery and finally at the Kruhovka festival in Vrbová in Slovakia.</description>

      <description>My name is Ksenia Gorchakova. I am a Russian designer specialising in interior architecture and furnishing. I originally studied architecture at the State University of Architecture, Design and Art in Novosibirsk. After completing my bachelor’s degree I worked as a designer of interiors and original furniture. In my study for a master’s degree I decided to extend my knowledge of the discipline of design from a slightly different perspective and I opted for the Studio of Product Design at the Faculty of Fine Arts of Brno University of Technology.</description>

      <description>I come from Eastern Slovakia, from a small town called Strážske. Currently I live and study in Brno. I completed studies for a bachelor’s degree in painting at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Banská Bystrica in the studio of Professor Stanislav Balko and later Ján Triaško. I took advantage of the Erasmus+ programme, when I had a chance to spend the whole semester at the Akadémia Sztuk Pieknych in Warsaw under tutorship of Professor Wojciech Zubala.</description>

      <description>My primary theme is the commonplace. I like to make ordinariness visible and to underline how important, delicate and negligible it is. It often runs between our fingers and we lose touch with its miracle.
I work with text. I created various objects, audio stories and sound installations. At the moment I am getting closer to artisan techniques, such as hand-made paper, wax batik and natural dyeing.
I have studied in the Studio of Body Design, and I completed a study placement in the Environmental Studio.</description>

      <description>My work is primarily based on drawing and with possible formal crossovers. In my creations I use drawing and graphic techniques to make spatial objects and object installations which often thematicise drawing in itself. The second significant point in my work is the question of material form and its circularity. I look at the world as a cluster of recycling material elements which permanently rotate in an infinite combinatoric number of forms.</description>

      <description>I studied in Studio of Painting 3 under Petr Kvíčala. Throughout the whole bachelor’s degree course I was accompanied by the theme of my grandad in connection with DIY and collecting. I devoted most of the time to painting. My paintings are typified by the collage method of work where I combine painting with other materials.
My work underwent a deep transformation during the master’s degree course when I left for placements in Poland and Spain.</description>

      <description>I have been studying at the Faculty of Fine Arts since 2014, when I enrolled in the Video Studio of Martin Zet. At the beginning of my study I concentrated on photography and the audiovisual medium. After a year-long study placement in the studio of stage and costume design at the Dresden Academy I abandoned video and work with the computer and began to spend more time at the sewing machine.</description>

      <description>In my work I combine aspects of technology and craftsmanship with an intuitive approach to the aesthetic side of the work. Familiarity with the method of application of the selected technology creates a pre-defined field for the effect of the aesthetic and this effect reclaims adapting the technology for its needs. A typical format of the work is a spatial installation incorporating sound and video. A frequently used element in my creations is an interactive form of content, which allows the viewer to influence the operation.</description>

In general I have always been interested in modern technology, interior design and creating 3D graphics. I like solid craftsmanship and working with traditional materials, as much as innovative approaches to design and finding untraditional solutions. Generative Furniture   The main motivation to become involved in the subject stemmed from my long-time general interest in advanced technologies and interior design.</description>

      <description>My current creations are characterised by post-media tendencies with an emphasis on sculptural qualities and the visual aesthetic of the work. My approach to work can be described as art research and the outcome as a hybrid “artScience” form. My works resonate with themes of global nature related to the present and the future state of the planet, political-economic order of society and the relationships between man and the surroundings. I also strive to produce a certain type of non-linear narrative in an effort to use a work of art as a specific information medium.</description>

      <description>Immediately after I finished my bachelor’s degree study of non-commissioned art, specifically in the Studio of Painting 1 (Faculty of Fine Arts of Brno University of Technology), I decided to complete my master’s degree in the Studio of Game Media. I received training in classical oil and digital painting which over time transformed into multiple directions, new concepts and object installations. I have a long-lasting interest in the subjects of portraiture, mainstream and pop culture, which I link with personal mythology.</description>
