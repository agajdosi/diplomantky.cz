<p>My work is primarily based on drawing and with possible formal crossovers. In my creations I use drawing and graphic techniques to make spatial objects and object installations which often thematicise drawing in itself. The second significant point in my work is the question of material form and its circularity. I look at the world as a cluster of recycling material elements which permanently rotate in an infinite combinatoric number of forms. In this world destruction does not mean an end, but rather it opens up space for a new beginning.</p>
<p>Apart from drawing and traditional graphic techniques I often use specific found natural objects that I transform by incorporating them in my installations.</p>

<p>Present day individualism affects almost every aspect of the form of life in today‘s western world. We adopt values from the outside and alienate ourselves from the sense of our own work and existence itself. We are exhausted by the incessant flow of uncountable opportunities that we most often cannot even touch. These invisible phenomena have gradually infiltrated even the private and intimate spheres where they surreptitiously took over the power over the commonplace in humans and ended up in an all-embracing social anxiety as a syndrome of the era of empty individualism and the spectacle of consumerism. This goes hand in hand with the ignorance and feeling of personal non-endangerment even in relation to far-reaching problems such as the threatening environmental crisis. We have an absolute freedom of opportunities, we are subordinated and obliged only to ourselves. The compulsive feelings of anxiety and personal discomfort resurface as a diagnosis of the impact of complicated political and social structures.</p>
<p>The project entitled Stuff That Can Make Me Sad thematicises the content framework of the feeling of physical nonconformity, anxiety and the obsessive feelings of mental discomfort and instability. In my work these feelings are treated as the consequence of the above-mentioned political and social influences. To a certain extent I build on the subjective feeling of discomfort in my own body. To demonstrate my theses I employ motifs of decaying human bodies and their consequent re-integration and creating new visual entities. In the drawings I merge parts of human bodies with various organic elements, mainly with plant segments. I find the moment of repeated re-creation and re-composition important for myself. Material transformation illustrates cyclic motion and recycling. I perceive this as a message of the immateriality of material things and the formal appearance itself. “We carry the whole world within us, as we are part of it”.</p>
