  <p>In my work I combine aspects of technology and craftsmanship with an intuitive approach to the aesthetic side of the work. Familiarity with the method of application of the selected technology creates a pre-defined field for the effect of the aesthetic and this effect reclaims adapting the technology for its needs. A typical format of the work is a spatial installation incorporating sound and video. A frequently used element in my creations is an interactive form of content, which allows the viewer to influence the operation. The combination of the requirements for adaptability of the technology and the work’s interactivity led me to a departure into the discourse of computer games while preserving the continuity with my previous experience.</p>
<p>I received a master’s degree in Multimedia Composition at the Janáček Academy of Performing Arts, During my studies I spent one semester at the Universität der Künste in Berlin in the Computational Art studio. I am currently about to finish my studies in the Game Media studio at the Faculty of Fine Arts.</p>

<p>Concrete is a diploma project situated on the boundary between a discourse of interactive art and a computer game. The work consists of an original controller (interactive object) and digital content, which is influenced by the controller. It is presented in the state of a functional prototype.</p>
<p>The original idea of the work arose by linking an earlier independent concept of an interactive object that was in the phase of an unfinished prototype and the idea of the Plan Libre architectural design. This design allows for a free rearrangement of partitions inside a fixed reinforced-concrete skeleton thus creating a number of possible layout combinations. These layouts are at the basis of the created game mechanics consisting of shifting the partitions and blocks. The player’s or viewer&rsquo;s goal is to reveal the original design.</p>
<p>The form of the controller is based on the mechanics of Rubik&rsquo;s Cube, which can change the arrangement of the individual segments within a fixed structure. Visually it is adapted to the digital content. The content is made up of architectural objects and situations. The aesthetics of this architecture are directly inspired by the architectural movement of Brutalism, which, within the framework of the project, stimulated the idea of free arrangement of prefabricated elements in space. The visual aspect of the content is created of textured 3D models, whose predefined parts may be regrouped based on the interaction of the player or viewer with the controller. These 3D models are original interpretations of signs and concrete architectural designs typical of Brutalist architecture. The basic layer of the textures is made up of photographs of the given materials which are further manipulated using generated elements. The combination of photographs with generated material ensured greater variability of the textures used. The interactivity of the content is provided for by the Unity game engine which communicates with the controller via a wireless Wi-Fi network.</p>
