Štěpán Brož was born in 1992 in the village of Řež near Prague. He works mainly in painting and drawing and occasionally graphic design for the bands and projects of his friends. Currently he is finishing his study in the Studio of Painting I (tutored by Vasil Artamonov) at the Faculty of Fine Arts of Brno University of Technology. He takes pleasure in rave music, droning black metal guitars and fantasy stories. To survive the struggle with living in a late capitalist society he is looking for possible overlaps between the magical, humour and seriousness.

As my diploma work I created a series of expressive figurative paintings. The series narrates fragments of stories unwinding in the wings of romantic fantasy sceneries and combined with contemporary subculture and leisure motifs. My art is based on extensive experience with the PC gaming worlds and a deep emotional bond with Central European landscape. The story takes place somewhere between a fairy tale past and a dystopic future.
