  <p>HUMAIN is a project, conference and platform opening up, associating, and connecting themes and experts from the areas of artificial intelligence, art, design and humanities.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is a phenomenon which can no longer be presented as a mere spectacle and an exhibition of robotic arms, or a useful technological curiosity. It is closer to us than may seem at first glance. The aim of the HUMAIN project is to show artificial intelligence in broad interdisciplinary contexts and frameworks (humanities, art and design), which so far have not been articulated in the Czech Republic. It is necessary to draw attention to the great number of perspectives and thematic aspects that touch on or will touch on everyone of us in the future. Artificial intelligence has stepped out of technological laboratories, industrial applications and IT. The merging of the human and the machine is taking on an intensive form of interdependent and inseparable spheres, as the project title suggests.</p>
<p>HUMAN + ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE = HUMAIN</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is a mirror of ourselves, our values, beliefs and goals. The year 2020 should become a time of asking ourselves new questions in this field.</p>
<p>The project is a collaboration between theorists and practitioners from the Faculty of Fine Arts of Brno University of Technology and the Faculty of Arts of Masaryk University and elsewhere.</p>
