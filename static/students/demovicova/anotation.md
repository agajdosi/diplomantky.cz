Home—Topia is an ongoing research and exhibition project concentrating on current forms of migration, uprooting and life between cultures. Home—Topia examines the notion of home, the feeling of belonging and the bonds with a physical space. Home—Topia is based on the assumption that different forms of mobility, migration and life in motion have become one of the basic characteristics of today’s world. 

The trajectory of the research, bibliography and the documentation of events are available to the public on the home-topia.eu platform.

The project was made up of an original interactive video installation exhibited at the Raum für Drastische Maßnahmen gallery in Berlin, which employed elements of extended reality.
