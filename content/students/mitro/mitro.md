My current creations are characterised by post-media tendencies with an emphasis on sculptural qualities and the visual aesthetic of the work. My approach to work can be described as art research and the outcome as a hybrid “artScience” form. My works resonate with themes of global nature related to the present and the future state of the planet, political-economic order of society and the relationships between man and the surroundings. I also strive to produce a certain type of non-linear narrative in an effort to use a work of art as a specific information medium.

In recent years I exhibited in the Czech Republic (Vasulka Kitchen, Studio Letná, Korespondance, Prototyp, DIG gallery), Slovakia (VUNU, Kasárne, Košice) and abroad (Gamma Festival, Saint Petersburg; Mediamatic, Amsterdam; JRM, Paris; Trafó, Budapest; Genius Loci, Weimar; Grey Space, den Haag, AV depot, London). Apart from the above activities I am a member of the STELLA research body,which maps out the penetration of technologies and motion art in the V4 countries, and the curator of ssesi.space.

With the work called Planetary Thermodynamics: Energy Justice I aim to depict the history of a utopia. One which has never happened. But what is more important, one which may happen. The initial stimulus is personal experience – an effort to create a temporary autonomous zone in a particular garden colony in Brno-Jundrov. This docufiction story starts where my personal experience ends. 

The impossibility or inability to transform a slice of space-time out of Fukuyama's end of history becomes the subject of research into speculative archaeology. I apply its methods to research into the current state of things from the point of view of the future status quo. This re-established ideology – a utopia and its unavoidable matter-of-factness – together with the above-mentioned historical excursion is the principal carrier of the meaning/message of the work. 

Through the spatial-visual arrangement of objects I intend to retell the story of a new future. It is built on the synergic interconnection of technological and natural sources and finally rejects and overcomes the anthropocentric dichotomy nature-culture. It perceives silicon and carbon chips and semiconductors in their mineral substantiality as augmented natural entities. The fauna and the flora have been re-acknowledged with the status of autonomous intelligent actors. The social, economic and political order of human relationships is built on a new distribution of material and symbolic being. This is derived directly from energy outputs and inputs calculated in Watts and Joules, which completely cancelled racial, gender, national, status and any other so far practised ways of social and generic segregation and exploitation. 

The work is an outcome of my long-term interest in the relationship of man, nature and technology in its multiple present and possible future positions.
