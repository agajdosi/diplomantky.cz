The attitude to designing the diplomantky.cz platform is to be the antithesis of the approach where the curator briefs the graphic designer on his vision, which the graphic designer subsequently attempts to metaphorically transform into different types of catalogue layout, objects on the cover or animations in the Facebook header. Creating representations of the curatorial approach, and trying to find the intersections of the different approaches of all the graduates, is replaced here by structuring the information in such a way that the newly emerging website is able to function both as the graduates’ portfolio and, simultaneously, as a tool for navigation in the programme of events and the overview of the sites where the individual exhibitions are taking place.

The current version lacks a few functions where implementation failed, such as the option of directly printing the complete promotional materials, including the catalogue, so that the full independence of the database will probably be left as a subject to be addressed by future projects. The current modified screenshots on posters and the catalogue cover represent only one of the methods of work with distributing information, which could provide a basis for the whole project in the future.

Whether this year’s format full of magnified URL addresses was an equally flat seasonal trend as the rendered chain on the cover of the catalogue from last year will probably be shown in the course of the next years.

Ideally, the existing infrastructure could still be used, upgraded and developed so as to serve as a true multifunctional tool that will disclose the least of the (un)fulfilled visions of its initiators and the most on the projects of the individual graduates.

I wish the end of the world would come. The world that I know. It will hurt. Not only myself. Like when you hold my hand too firmly. And I realise that you did not fall, thanks to me.

It is May 2017 and I am installing my diploma work at the House of the Lords of Kunštát. The curators are mocking the “weaker ones”. Not me.

Cūrāre (from Latin) - to attend to, to take care of, to provide for.

It’s 18/9/2020 and I am touching my face with disinfected fingers.

When Andreas Gajdošík invited me to co-organise this year’s exhibition of FFA graduates, I wanted to collaborate in “something” that would survive the stale bubbly wine of formal exhibition openings, throwing all graduating students into the same bag. My wish to be able to apply smatterings of human-centred design with Jakub Polach and the FFA graduates has come true. The result is a database/exhibition/7 sites/7 openings = fun for “everyone”.

Dear graduates and people. Over the past four months I have tried to set up the process from my privileged position. I was interested in you in the first place - in your wishes and requirements. I admit that at the beginning of the process I had a pre-understanding of the situation. The opinion that the presentation of the graduates’ works should serve you in particular and the curator/organiser/designer should play a servicing role. Pull the strings primarily for your benefit. Facilitate communication with other representatives of the umbrella organisation, (FFA BUT), and provide and create space for you.

Mum, I’d rather go home. It’s gonna rain. No, it won‘t. Look, the display shows sun and small clouds.

Human-centred design has its limits. It’s important to take into consideration the diversity of the actors. It’s not just my wish, my pre-understanding that matters.

Who knows whether in the end the opening will take place at all.

I feel certain about one thing. I was happy when I could smile at the graduates, Jakub and Andreas during personal contact, so rare between us, unfortunately. I learn to scrape the sediment of reserve in my expression and actions. Reserve, the basis on which I was brought up by my ambitious parents from the past century. Write more for them and risk that the proof-reader will not correct it and the translator won‘t translate?

Precisely modelled infrastructure  
ready for transmission.  
Of a poem about a statistical item of data.  
A poem about being informal, imperfect and unedited.

## Andreas Gajdošík

It is extremely rare to witness a hiccup in the ruling narrative. Particularly in a situation where we buried all of the great narratives long ago, including the history in which they were written. Yet, at the end of history, with eyes moist with the liquids of modernity, we had a chance to see something really pompous: neoliberal individualism wavering for a moment.

For a while my face covering protected you and not me. My hands helped you carry shopping, sew face masks, hand out food and the head was allowed to think about how you may feel all of the time.

Critical patch ups of neoliberal logic were quickly drawn up, software of the economised world swiftly recovered from fatal error and started up as a new upgraded version: the face mask is again restricting my freedom, handing out anything is once more considered non-market foolishness and thoughts about others are merely superfluous idleness, a tiny black spot on an otherwise perfect career.

But it seems the time that we have lived through is hard to erase from our memories.

It would be naïve to say that we have briefly experienced a world beyond the market. We have not. It would be equally naïve to state that for a moment we have overcome individualism. We have not.

But we were given a precious opportunity to see the other as a human being and not a competitor. To exchange the endless state of alertness and worries for simple trust.

And for a minute to discover how it feels to act out the prisoner’s dilemma when the inmates of the system work together.

As a curatorial team we have approached the exhibition of FFA Graduates 2020 in a similar spirit – with scepticism towards the entrenched structures of power and, conversely, with trust in others.

Trust in the collaborators, but most importantly in the graduates themselves – in the exhibiting artists and designers. With confidence that it is they who know best how to present themselves and their works in the online environment, as well as in the gallery and outside it.

It might seem a paradox to speak critically of individualism and concurrently refuse to create a unifying curatorial concept or a narrative of a collective exhibition. And instead, leave its design and the solution up to twenty-two original artists and designers. However, scepticism towards competitive individualism and faith in the individual need not be in opposition, provided they play out in the field of mutual trust and openness towards the other.

In the turbulent times of the pandemic and insecurity we approached the Diplomantky.cz exhibition and database as a trusted autonomous zone.
